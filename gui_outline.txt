How I want the Twitter app to be set up:

- Big title that says "Misspelled Twitter" with Twitter font and a twitter logo somewhere
- Try to make it look like Twitter was behind this app, use their style of design as best as possible
- use two text boxes to input for username and number of recent tweets
- make a run button at the bottom
- TODO: think of a way to output the incorrect words and whole tweets
  - a non-writable text box?
  - output a text file
