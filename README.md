# misspelled_twitter

## What This Program Does:
This Python program is designed to go through a users' tweets and find any misspelled words in their tweets using "PyEnchant" and "tweepy" Python libraries. This is mostly targeted at @realDonaldTrump

## Inspiration:
This project was inspired by Trump's infamous "covfefe" tweet he posted, and deleted, back in May 2017. Of course, this wasn't the first time Trump has misspelled a word in one of his tweets. I've also been wanting to learn web scraping and Python. Thus, I created this project in which it goes through Trump's (or any public Twitter users') most recent tweets and finds incorrect words.

## How to run it:
1. Download the zip file, unzip it.
2. "cd" into the directory
3. Run this in your shell:
   ```
   chmod +x main.py
   python main.py
   ```
4. Enter a twitter handle when prompted (only does public accounts) and the number of most recent tweets.
